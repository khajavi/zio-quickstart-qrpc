# ZIO Quickstart gRPC

This is the simplest quickstart for a ZIO application. You can download and run it very quickly. This will give you an idea of how to write similar apps.

## Quickstart Guide

We have a dedicated article about this quickstart at the ZIO documentation website called [ZIO Quickstart: gRPC](https://zio.dev/next/quickstarts/zio-quickstart-grpc).

## Running The Example

First, open the console and clone the project using `git` (or you can simply download the project) and then change the directory:

```scala
git clone git@github.com:khajavi/zio-quickstart-grpc.git 
cd zio-quickstart-grpc
```

Once you are inside the project directory, run the application:

```scala
sbt run
```
